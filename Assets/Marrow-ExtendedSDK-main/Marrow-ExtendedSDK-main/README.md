# Info
This repository allows the extension of the BONELAB Marrow SDK, allowing you to create custom guns and other types of items not yet supported by the Marrow SDK.

One of the major objectives of this repo, is to remove incentives to decompile the game, through strategic inclusion of assets which aren't useful elsewhere, and thorough documentation of what's possible.

# How to Install

Follow steps 1-5 from the official SDK over at https://github.com/StressLevelZero/MarrowSDK/wiki#project-setup

In step 6, you'll want to import these three packages via github URL:

https://github.com/StressLevelZero/Custom-RenderPipelineCore.git

https://github.com/StressLevelZero/Custom-URP.git#Bonelab

https://github.com/Kairus101/MarrowSDKExt.git

Using the green Code dropdown at the top of this page, download a zip of this repositry, and unzip it's contents into your Assets folder to have Assets/Marrow-ExtendedSDK

Continue following steps 7+ from the official SDK documentation.

### Check out the included Examples folder for ideas on how to create Guns and Levels.

# Disclaimer
Stress Level Zero's Official Bonelab SDK is MIT licenced, and by extension, so is all of this. Updates to the official SDK may break this repo at any time and there is no guaranteed support, so use at your own risk. With any luck, updates to the Official SDK will make this extension repo obsolete.

### This repo only has dummy scripts and basic data to get people started.
### It deliberately does not have any art, code implementation, or other IP from the Bonelab game or elsewhere. There is nothing useful here that can be used outside of Bonelab modding, and will be kept that way.
